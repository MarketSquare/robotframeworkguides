# About Us

## Who we are

We are a group of Robot Framework users who like to share their good practices and knowledge.
The rich **Robot Framework ecosystem** - with its tools and libraries - is as important to us as the **Robot Framework Core** itself.  

So a lot of our guides will also focus on the ecosystem. 
We want to show you what **tools and practices** might help you on your Robot Framework journey.
Help you to be *successful* - and also to have *more fun*.

We hope that people will find this guide useful and that it will help them to write better tests and create better test automation solutions.

## Why we do this

When I started using Robot Framework, I was always impressed with the documentation and the examples.
The [User Guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html) and the [Keyword Documentation](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/#standard-libraries) were very helpful and always open in by browser while working. 

When I discovered the [Slack Channel](https://robotframework.slack.com/), I got another productivity boost. My questions there were answered quicker than by any professional support of any tool I've ever used.

But there was also another thing I noticed:  
Some of the question were repeating.
- "Which IDE shall I used?"
- "What extensions do I need?"
- "Can I debug with Robot Framework?"
- "How to integrate Robot Framework with Test Management Tool XYZ?"
- "How to run Robot Framework in a CI system?"
- ...

Often, the answers were provided.
But a Slack channel is not helpful for storing information or searching for it.
So we needed a different platform to conserve that information - allowing other users to find that information easily.  
That's when **Robot Framework Guides** was born.

## How we do this

We want to be sure, our guides are helpful to a lot of people.  
But as people learn differently, we did not want to focus on one specific method or medium.

So you will find 
- some written guides
- combined with links to existing videos
- maybe some embedded code examples
- links to recipes of the [Robot Framework Cookbook](https://github.com/adrianyorke/robotframework-cookbook/)
- whatever else comes to our mind
