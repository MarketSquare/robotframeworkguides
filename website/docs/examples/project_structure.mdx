## Root Folder

- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies or
- `pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies
- `Readme.md` - Project description
- `.gitignore` - Lists files and folders to be ignored by git

Depending on the project, the root folder can contain additional files, e.g. `.gitlab-ci.yml` for a GitLab CI Pipeline.

## Test Suites

**Test Suites** are located in the `tests/` folder.  
Depending on the project, the Test Suites can be organized in multiple `.robot` files and subfolders.

- `tests/` - Test Suites folder
    - `search.robot` - Test Suite for Search functionality
    - `login.robot` - Test Suite for Log In functionality
    - `checkout/` - Folder containing Test Suites for Checkout
        - `checkout_basic.robot` - Test Suites for standard Checkout
        - `checkout_premium.robot` - Test Suites for premium Checkout
    - ...

## Resources

Reusable keywords are stored in `.resource` files in the `resources` folder.  
Also `Python` keywords in `.py` files can be stored there.

- `resources/` - Reusable keywords
    - `common.resource` - General Keywords (e.g. Login/Logout, Navigation, ...) are stored here
    - `search.resource` - Keywords for searching are stored here
    - `utils.py` - Python helper keywords are stored here
    - ...

## Libraries

Custom Python Keyword libraries can be stored in a separate `libraries/` folder, if needed.  
Some projects like to seperate the `libraries/` from the `resources/`.

## Examples

Find some example project structures below.

### Simple Project with `tests/` and `resources/` folders:

A flat project structure for a simple project with a few test cases and keywords.  
All test suites are in the `tests/` folder and all keywords, variables and python libraries are in the `resources/` folder.  
The project root folder contains the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for CI/CD, the `.gitignore` file for git, the `README.md` file for documentation and the `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.


```text
my_project
├── tests
│   ├── suiteA.robot
│   ├── suiteB.robot
│   ├── ...
│   
├── resources
│   ├── common.resource
│   ├── some_other.resource
│   ├── custom_library.py
│   ├── variables.py
│   ├── ...
│
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
```	

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  resources/common.resource
Resource  resources/some_other.resource
Library   resources/custom_library.py
Variables resources/variables.py
...
```

Tests can be run with the following command (assuming you are in the project root folder `my_project`):  

```shell
$ robot --pythonpath . tests
```

### Project with `tests/`, `resources/` and `data/` folders:

A project structure for a more complex project with a more test cases and keywords.  
Test Suites are organized in subfolders in the `tests/` folder.
Keywords, variables and python libraries are organized in subfolders in the `resources/` folder.
Test Data files - like Python or Yaml Variable files - are organized in subfolders in the `data/` folder.  
The project root folder contains the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for CI/CD, the `.gitignore` file for git, the `README.md` file for documentation and the `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.

```text
my_project
├── tests
│   ├── authentication
│   │   ├── login.robot
│   │   ├── ...
│   │
│   ├── master-data
│   │   ├── customers.robot
│   │   ├── products.robot
│   │   ├── ...
│   │
│   ├── order
│   │   ├── order_creation.robot
│   │   ├── order_processing.robot
│   │   ├── ...
│   
├── resources
│   ├── common.resource
│   ├── search.resource

│   │   ├── order_processing.yaml
│   │   ├── ...
│
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
```

The tests/authentication/login.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  resources/common.resource
Resource  resources/search.resource
Resource  resources/master-data/customers.resource
Variables data/master-data/customers.py
...
```

Tests can be run with the following command (assuming you are in the project root folder `my_project`):  

```shell
$ robot --pythonpath . tests
```

## Telling Robot Framework where to search libraries, resource and variable files

Robot Framework searches for libraries, resource and variable files in  

- the same directory as the test suite file (or resource file) which imports the library, resource or variable file
- the directories listed in `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
- the directories passed in `--pythonpath` command line argument

The examples below will focus on resource files, but the same applies to libraries and variables.

:::note  

It is always possible to use absolute paths in the `Resource`,`Library` and `Variables` statements.  
Especially with the `${CURDIR}` variable, it is easy to construct absolute paths relative to the current file.  
However, this is not recommended, as it makes the tests less portable.

:::

You can find more information about the search order in the [Robot Framework User Guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#configuring-where-to-search-libraries-and-other-extensions).

### Good Practice: Use `--pythonpath` command line argument and `resources/` subfolder

Before we look at the other options, let's look at the recommended approach.
Organize your files in subfolders (e.g. `resources/`, `libraries/`, `data/`) and use the `--pythonpath` command line argument to add the project root folder to the search path.  

In that case, resources can be imported with a relative path from the `resources/` folder (e.g. `Resource  resources/common.resource`) and libraries can be imported with a relative path from the `libraries/` folder (e.g. `Library  libraries/custom_library.py`).

Let's assume we have the following project structure:

```text
my_project
├── tests
│   └── suiteA.robot
└── resources
    ├── general.resource
    └── auth/
        ├── login.resource
        └── totp.py
```

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  resources/general.resource
Resource  resources/auth/login.resource
Library   resources/auth/totp.py
...
```

#### Run from shell

You can run the tests with the following command (assuming you are in the project root folder `my_project`):  

```shell
$ robot --pythonpath . tests/suiteA.robot
```

:::tip

The `.` in the `--pythonpath` argument means "the current directory".  
In this case, the current directory is the project root folder `my_project`.

:::

#### Run from IDE

To run the tests directly from your IDE, you also need to configure the `--pythonpath` argument in your IDE.  
In `VS Code` with `RobotCode` extension, you can add the following line to your `settings.json` file.  
You can also find the setting under `File > Preferences > Settings` by searching for `robotcode.robot.pythonPath`.  
 
```json
"robotcode.robot.pythonPath": [
    "./"
    ],
```

:::tip

You can also add the `resources/` , `libraries/` or `keywords/` folders  to the `pythonPath` setting:

```json
"robotcode.robot.pythonPath": [
    "./",
    "./libraries",
    "./resources",
    "./keywords",
    ],
```

That way, you can import libraries, resources and variables from the `resources/`, `libraries/` and `keywords/` folders without the `resources/`, `libraries/` or `keywords/` prefix.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  general.resource
Resource  auth/login.resource
Library   auth/totp.py
...
```

:::  

#### Run from CI/CD

To run the tests from CI/CD, you also need to configure the `--pythonpath` argument in your CI/CD pipeline.
    
    ```yaml
    robot:
      stage: test
      image: python:3.8
      script:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - robot --pythonpath . tests/
    ```

#### Using CI_PROJECT_DIR variable

If you are using GitLab CI/CD, you can use the `CI_PROJECT_DIR` variable to construct the `--pythonpath` argument.  
The `CI_PROJECT_DIR` variable contains the absolute path to the project root folder.  
    
    ```yaml
    robot:
      stage: test
      image: python:3.8
      script:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - robot --pythonpath $CI_PROJECT_DIR tests/
    ```  

----

### Resource file in the same directory as the Test Suite file

Let's assume we have the following project structure:

```text
my_project
└── tests
    ├── suiteA.robot
    └── general.resource
```	

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  general.resource
...
```

The tests/suiteA.robot file can import the general.resource file without any additional configuration.

```shell
$ robot tests/suiteA.robot
```

----

### Using absolute paths with `${CURDIR}` and `resources/` subfolder

Let's assume we have the following project structure:

```text
my_project
├── tests
│   └── suiteA.robot
└── resources
    └── general.resource
```

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  ${CURDIR}/../resources/general.resource
...
```

The `${CURDIR}` variable contains the absolute path to the directory of the current file.  
The `..` in the path means "one directory up".  
This way, the tests/suiteA.robot file can import the general.resource file without any additional configuration.

```shell
$ robot tests/suiteA.robot
```

#### More subfolders means more `..` in the path

Let's assume we have the following project structure:

```text
my_project
├── tests
│   ├── suiteA.robot
│   └── topicB
│       └── suiteB.robot
└── resources
    └── auth
        └── login.resource
```

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  ${CURDIR}/../resources/auth/login.resource
...
```

The tests/topicB/suiteB.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  ${CURDIR}/../../resources/auth/login.resource
...
```

You can see that the number of `..` in the path depends on the number of subfolders between the test suite file and the resource file.  
Because of that, it is recommended to use the `--pythonpath` command line argument instead of absolute paths.

----

### Using `--pythonpath` command line argument and `resources/` subfolder

Let's assume we have the following project structure:

```text
my_project
├── tests
│   └── suiteA.robot
└── resources
    └── general.resource
```	

The tests/suiteA.robot file looks like this:

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  resources/general.resource
...
```

To run the tests, we need to tell Robot Framework where to search for the libraries, resource and variable files.
If we run it without any arguments, we will get an error:

```shell
$ robot tests/suiteA.robot
[Error] Error in file 'tests/suiteA.robot': ...
Resource file 'resources/general.resource' does not exist.
...
```

We can add the project root folder `my_project/` folder to the `--pythonpath` command line argument:

```shell
$ robot --pythonpath . tests/suiteA.robot
```

Now the tests run successfully.

:::tip

You can also add the `resources/` , `libraries/` or `keywords/` folders  to the `--pythonpath` setting:

```shell
$ robot --pythonpath .:./libraries:./resources:./keywords tests/suiteA.robot
```

That way, you can import libraries, resources and variables from the `resources/`, `libraries/` and `keywords/` folders without the `resources/`, `libraries/` or `keywords/` prefix.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Resource  general.resource
Resource  auth/login.resource
Library   auth/totp.py
...
```

:::


### Using `PYTHONPATH` environment variable

Alternatively, you can add the path to your project root folder to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  
Then you can run the tests without the `--pythonpath` command line argument (assuming you are in the project root folder `my_project`):  

Bash
```shell
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
$ robot tests/suiteA.robot
```

PowerShell
```powershell
> $env:PYTHONPATH += ";."
> robot tests/suiteA.robot
```
