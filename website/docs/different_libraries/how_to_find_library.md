# What technology does your Application under Test use?

That's the main question, when searching for a library to steer your application.  
Sure, there are libraries out there, which use image and text recognition to find controls and interact with them.  
But nothing beats a library which can steer your application natively via it's exposed interfaces.

## Web Applications

### Libraries steering the UI of a Web Application in a Web Browser

There are two main libraries which can automate web applications in a web browser:    
- [Selenium Library](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/)
- [Browser Library](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser)

### Libraries that can automate Web Services and RESTful APIs

- [Requests Library](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-requests)


## Desktop Applications

### Does it offer a User Interface?
Automation via the User Interface is a common approach, even though it can be very unstable, slow and heavy on the maintenance.  
But if your Application offers a User Interface, there is also the possibility to automate it via that User Interface.  
That's where the used technology becomes important.
